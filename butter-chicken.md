# Butter Chicken Recipe

Butter Chicken is a combination of two indian dishes.
1. Tandoori Chicken
2. Makhani Gravy

## Tandoori Chicken
### Ingredients
2.2 lbs of skinless chicken

### Marinade 1
- 1 tsp of paprika powder
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1 tsp of (kashmiri if you can get it) red chilli powder
- salt to taste
- 1 tsp of liquid smoke (optional)

1. Combine ingredients.
2. Wash and cut chicken into pieces. If leaving the pieces larger than 2 inches, take a knife and make a bunch of deep slices through the chicken so the marinade dosent just stay on the surface. I usually leave the pieces large because they stay jucier.
3. Thoroughly coat chicken with marinade and cover.
4. Refrigerate for 2 - 4 hours.

### Marinade 2
 - 1 cup of greek yogurt
- garlic paste (2 tsbp)
- ginger paste (1 tbsp)
- 1 tsp (kashmiri) red chilli powder
- 1 tsp garam masala powder
- salt to taste

#### Garlic Paste (7 - 12 cloves of garlic)
1. Peel garlic and slice ends.
2. Put garlic into a food processor ( or mortar pestle) with a little bit of water.
3. Process till it forms a paste.

#### Ginger Paste (2 inches of ginger)
1. See above


1. Drain first marinade.
2. Combine all ingredients into the yogurt, making sure to mix well so the spices and ginger garlic paste are distributed evenly.
3. Cover the chicken with yogurt making sure all of the pieces are thoroughly covered.
4. Wait for 45 mins - 1.5 hours.

### Oven
1. Preheat the oven to 450 (while waiting for the second marinade).
2. Take a baking pan with a slotted rack so that the juices can drain down the rack into the pan.
3. Put the chicken pieces onto the rack taking care not to get too much of the marinade onto the rack.
4. Bake till the chicken is almost done.
5. Turn the oven to broil.
6. Baste the chicken with butter.
7. Cook for 2 - 4 minutes.
8. Flip to the other side.
9. Baste the other side with butter.
9. Cook for 2 minutes.

### Grill
Grill the chicken on 450 till juices run clear.

## EZ MODE
the ez mode version is like - buy rotisserie chicken, deskin, shred the meat, make the gravy and and shredded chicken right before you add the whipping cream and butter. And use tomato puree 32 oz can instead of making the puree from scratch
